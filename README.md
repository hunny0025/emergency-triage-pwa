🚑 Upline – Emergency Triage System
Smart • Fast • Offline-Ready • Voice-Enabled

Upline Emergency Triage is a modern emergency response application built to help medical staff quickly assess, prioritize, and manage patients during critical situations.
The system is designed to work even without internet, making it ideal for ambulances, disaster zones, rural healthcare, and emergency rooms.

This project combines the power of a Progressive Web App (PWA) with the reach of an Android application, delivering speed, reliability, and accessibility when it matters the most.

🌟 Why Upline?

In emergency situations, every second matters.
Upline focuses on reducing decision time by providing a clean interface, priority-based triage logic, and optional voice assistance for hands-free operation.

It is lightweight, fast, and optimized for real-world emergency workflows.
